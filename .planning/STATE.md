Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **8-character short IDs** for shareable URLs (01-01)
- **URL-safe alphabet** without ambiguous characters 0OIl (01-01)
- **7-day session expiration** for balance between persistence and cleanup (01-01)
- **Mock mode fallback** for testing without Supabase (01-01)
- **Axios for file upload progress tracking** (01-03) - using onUploadProgress callback
- **Sequential file uploads** (01-03) - one at a time for better progress feedback
- **Client-side validation matching server-side** (01-03) - 10MB limit, same file types
- **30-second auto-save interval** (01-04) - balances persistence with server load
- **1-second debounce after changes** (01-04) - prevents excessive save requests
- **Last-write-wins for offline queue** (01-04) - simpler than conflict resolution
